# Simple Twitter Feed (Completed code)

May 11th seminar for Muses Code JS facilitated by **Steve Kane**

This repo is for the **mentors** to look at before the day.

I'll create a separate repo (with most of the code gone) for the students on the day.

## Getting started

- In your terminal, go to your projects folder (or create one) and clone this repo `$ git clone git@github.com:steve1000/training-react-graphql.git`
- Enter directory `$ cd training-react-graphql`
- Run `$ npm install` to install project dependencies
- Add the Graphcool service ID into App.js (get this from Steve)
- Run `$ npm start`
- Start developing!

## Technology used

- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Apollo GraphQL](https://www.apollographql.com/)
- [Graphcool](https://www.graph.cool/)
- [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)

## Methodologies used

- [Container component pattern](https://medium.com/teamsubchannel/react-component-patterns-e7fb75be7bb0)
- [BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/)

## Good to know (but not essential)

- [Higher order components](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html) (to better understand how Apollo is injected into the component)
- ES6 features: [async/await](https://devhints.io/es6#promises), [object destructuring](https://devhints.io/es6#destructuring), [spread operator](https://devhints.io/es6#spread), [arrow functions](https://devhints.io/es6#functions), [object shorthand syntax](https://devhints.io/es6#objects-1) (I use a lot of ES6 syntax, we might need to explain to the students some of the above concepts if they haven't seen them before)

## Seminar order

1. Breif introduction to Steve (work history + technologies)
2. Overview on what we'll be doing on the day (+ theme)
3. Housekeeping: What to do if you're finding it difficult. What to do if you're finding it too easy. (extensions are marked in this codebase)
4. Talk about GraphQL from a front-end developer's perspective. Touch on queries and mutations.
5. Talk about Graphcool and how I've set it up (and why it's a handy tool)
6. Make sure everyone is set up with the cloned repository
7. Go through data flow diagram on [Whimsical](https://whimsical.co) and talk about why having flow diagrams are so important in the SDLC.
8. Start going through our component setup. What components we need, how we are going to split them up. Where we will put our data layer.
9. Add in our code

The format will involve a discussion on what we want to write. I'll ask a few leading questions, then we'll add the code together, then maybe a little Q&A after each section. We'll keep repeating that till we have our working app.

There will be parts where I'll start the basics on the screen and give the developers a bit of time to make some extensions on them.
